# SpreadHealth: Empowering Public Health through Social Media

I developed this project in 3 weeks at [Insight Health Data Science](http://insighthealthdata.com), with R, python, SQL, Flask, AWS, etc. 
This repo contains the production codes for the Web App [SpreadHealth.tech](http://www.spreadhealth.tech):
- A Flask App that predicts how likely a tweet will be retweeted.
- More detailed description of this project is published in my other [repo](https://github.com/zweinstein/SpreadHealth_dev)n/SpreadHealth_dev)
